Directory Structure Standards


Every directory will have a readme describing what the directory is for.

At minimum, we will have the following directories:
    * Documents - Holds project standards and other documents.
    * Spikes - Holds spikes.
    * src - Holds source code.
    * Stories - Holds user stories.
    * Tests - Holds unit tests.
