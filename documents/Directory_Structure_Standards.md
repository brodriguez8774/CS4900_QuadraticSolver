## Directory Structure Standards

Every directory will have a readme describing at a minimum the purpose of the directory. If the directory contains source code, there will also be instructions for compiling the code along with example output so the user knows what to expect. This project contains several directories with separate purposes, laid out as follows:
* Root - contains the license, all other directories, as well as files that are required by all programs used by the project
* Documents - any documents relevant to the creation and implementation of the project.
* Spikes - any spike programs created to aid us in understanding the project.
* Src - all code and necessary files used for the quadratic solver program specifically
* Stories - all stories and TPS reports created to track project completion
* Tests - all unit tests created for the quadratic solver program
