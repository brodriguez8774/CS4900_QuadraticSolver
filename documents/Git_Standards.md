## Git Standards

In order to maintain reliablility within our program, we must create standards for committing. Before we can push a commit to GitHub, we must ensure the following:
* A readme exists for every directory
* All unit tests must pass
* File naming conventions are met
* Only a user with sufficient permissions may contribute
* Programming standards apply to every source file
* If pushing code, commit description must be provided
* Adding/changing files need only a default commit description
