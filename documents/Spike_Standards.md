## Spike Standards

To help us understand the data and tools we are going to be working with for the quadratic solver, spikes will be created for the various topics:
* IEEE Floating Point numbers
* Handling input from multiple sources
* Logging output to files
* Makefiles
* The sqrt() function from the Math library
* Unit Testing in CUnit

All spikes will be created using the C programming language.
