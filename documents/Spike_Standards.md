# C - Quadratic Solver > Documents > Spike Standards

## Description
To help us understand the data and tools we are going to be working with for the quadratic solver, spikes will be created for the various topics:

* IEEE Floating Point numbers.
* Handling input from multiple sources.
* Logging output to files.
* Makefiles Useage beyond standard compiliation.
* The sqrt() function from the Math library.
* Unit Testing in CUnit.
* Variable Macros for accepting arbitrary length arguments.

All spikes will be created using the C programming language and placed into their own subdirectories within the spikes directory.
