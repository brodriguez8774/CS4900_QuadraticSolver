# C - Quadratic Solver > Spikes

## Description
This directory contains all the spikes we wrote to help us understand the tools and data we deemed necessary to complete the quadratic solver program. Within each subdirectory is a separate folder that contains one or more spikes related to the subject.

Each spike is written in a combination of the C programming language and makefiles.

## Running Spikes
Every spike will provide some initial output by running

    $make

in the given directory.

Most will simply run the full spike with the make command. On the occassion that two or more spikes are in one single folder, then the above command will display valid make arguments to run each spike.
