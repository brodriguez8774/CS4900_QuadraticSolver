# C - Quadratic Solver > Spikes

## Description
This directory contains all the spikes we wrote to help us understand the tools and data we deemed necessary to complete the quadratic solver program. Within each subdirectory is a separate folder that contains one spike. Each spike is written in the C programming language, with the exception of the _make_ spike.
