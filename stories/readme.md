# C - Quadratic Solver > Stories

## Description
Archive of stories and TPS reports used for the Quadratic Solver. The title of each document refers to the week for which they were turned in to the professor, not the week in which the stories and tasks were completed. Dates are always the monday of the given week.

For example, _Stories 2018-10-08.docx_ means the document was turned into the professor on October 6th, but the stories were updated between September 31st and October 6th.
