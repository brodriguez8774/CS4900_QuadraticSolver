## Description
Archive of stories reports used for the Quadratic Solver. The title of each document refers to the date of Monday from the week for which they were turned in to the professor, not the week in which the stories and tasks were completed. For example, _Stories 2018-10-07.docx_ means the document was turned into the professor on October 6th, but the stories were updated between September 31st and October 6th.
